### 4.2.45 Badges

When the user needs to be notified of events, deadlines, group work or messages then badges should show up with the correct count of any of the above that have not been seen by the user. Additionally when the user goes through the badges the count should decrease as the badges are seen. If they have all been seen then that badge should disappear.
