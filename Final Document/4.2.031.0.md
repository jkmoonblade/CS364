### 4.2.31 Group Permissions

Validation will be successful if the user can set restrictions and permissions within their groups.

#### 4.2.31.1 Group owners have access to all the groups resources

This will be tested by creating a group and setting certain permissions. After those are set we will see if the group owner can still access all the resources in the group.

#### 4.2.31.2 Group members can be aware of what is happening in their group

Validation will be successful when permissions are set and group is aware of those permissions given or set.
