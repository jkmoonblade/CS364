#### 3.2.29.1 Find a Location

| Data          | Description |
|:--------------| :--------------|
|Use Case Detail  | As a user of one of the map applications I want to be able to find where I need to go when I schedule it on my calendar.|
|XRef           | |
|Trigger        | A scheduled event with an address is clicked.|
|Precondition   | By default, the user will see an option to create an event or task for a specific day.|
|Basic Path     | 1. The user creates an event on a specific day by clicking or tapping on "create event."<br>2. The user adds an address on the "Where" item of the create event screen.<br>3. The application goes back to the calendar view and shows an icon (map with a pin) next to the added event.<br>4. If user clicks or taps on the map/pin icon, application sends address of event as a destination to user's DEFAULT map application|
|Alternate Path | In step 1, the user may have already created an event or task in previous interactions. The user can just click on the event and add a location. Return to step 4. If a user does not have a default map application then use the google maps browser for step 4.|
|Post Condition | The user and their event location is sent to their DEFAULT map application which will plan a route to the location of the event from their current position.|
|Exception Paths| The attempt may be abandoned at any time. If a user does not have a default map application then use the google maps browser for step 4. |
|Other          | None.|
