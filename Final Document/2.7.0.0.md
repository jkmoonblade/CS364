## 2.7 User Documentation

When a user creates an account with the Student Calendar application, a video tutorial will be the first thing that they encounter in the application. This tutorial will quickly run the user through the most important features to get started on using the calendar. Additionally there will be separate tutorials on the other features not covered in the initial tutorial that the user can look at when they need some extra help.
