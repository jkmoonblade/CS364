### 3.2.25 Continuous Calendar

Users need to access the different months efficiently. The Calendar app will have a scrollable section where all the months can be accessed. The idea of the continuous calendar is that users will intuitively know that they can scroll to other months, weeks, or days. In the case of a Month view, the last week of the prior month, and the first week of the next month will be added to the current month view as a visual cue that the section is scrollable. Text labels and color backgrounds will help the user identify the month as they scroll.
