## 4.5 Verify Logical Database Requirements

The logical database requirements will be verified by using the Calendar Assignments, Calendar Events, and Users relational tables as defined in section 3.5 to successfully store information from the I-learn system and retrieve the data for displaying user assignments and events on the Student Calendar. The tester will create a new assignment and event within the application which will be saved to the database. The tester will then log off of the application and sign back in to verify that the items where stored and retrieved successfully.
