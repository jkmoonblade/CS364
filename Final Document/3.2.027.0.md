### 3.2.27 Location

Because users will be able to add details to a task or event, an option to add addresses to a specific event or task will be available to coordinate group meetings or other social gatherings. This feature will help users to conveniently link addresses to events and display a map view of the addresses using user's Map application. The Map application will also be used to display directions to a location.
