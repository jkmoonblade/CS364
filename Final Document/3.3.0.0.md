## 3.3 Usability Requirements

The Student calendar must be uniform in its appearance and functionality to improve learnability for the user. This will be accomplished through the following criteria:

### Simple GUI

The application will have large functional icons visible to the user whenever they are viewing the Main or daily calendar pages.

The process of adding, removing, and modifying events should require similar steps to make easy to remember and perform those actions.

### Navigation

The Student Calendar will be able to move from each view to another with no more than one click.

Each window must feature a close 'X' icon to make it simple for the user to cancel any action and return to the previous view

### Tutorial

New Users will be introduced to the Student Calendar functionality through tutorial message windows.

The application will offer a help menu that the user may select to learn how to find commonly used features.
