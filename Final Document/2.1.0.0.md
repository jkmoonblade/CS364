## 2.1 Product Perspective

The Student Calendar can be used as a stand-alone application that gives students much of the functionality as described in the product functions section. For BYU-I students, the calendar's main benefits come from interfacing with the University's I-Learn system allowing them to access assignments and other events. Interfaces to other external systems will provide further functionality outside of basic calendar tasks. Detailed descriptions of these external systems are beyond the scope of this document. All interfacing with external systems will be done according to industry standards.</br>
