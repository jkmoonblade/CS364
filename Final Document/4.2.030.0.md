### 4.2.30 Video Tutorial

Validation will be successful if we have a video, 10 minutes or less in length, that explains basic functionality for new calendar users. The video should cover how to create and edit a calendar item, how to use group events, and how to access different calendar views. The video should be displayed when a new user opens the application for the first time.

#### 4.2.30.1 Learning Application Capabilities

We will test this by having a new user open the calendar, and verifying that the link to the tutorial video pops up. They will click the link, and after watching the new user will create a new calendar item, join a group event, and access different calendar views to verify that the tutorial was clear. If they fail then adjustment to the tutorial video is needed.
