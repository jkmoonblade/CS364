## 3.6 Design Constraints

The main design constraints of the Student Calendar will be its web based platform. The user will be required to have an web browser to access the application. The application will not be able to run on all web browsers, so system design will be tailored to work with the more popular web browsers. The application will also be subject to standards of compliance for FERPA, ADA, and BYU-Idaho. This will place constraints on how data may be transferred between the application and I-learn. It will also require added functionality, such as voice recognition, so that disabled students may use the application. All text and language used in the software must comply with BYU-Idaho's honor code.
