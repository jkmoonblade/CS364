## 1.6 Overview of Document

This document is broken out into multiple sections and each section covers different topics related to the overall design and specification of this application. Section 1.0 of this document covers the introduction and highlevel outline for the document. Section 2.0 provides an overview of the application that will be implemented where as section 3.0 begins the deeper technical specifications and functionality of the application. Section 4.0 of the document will cover the validation of the functional requirements.

The main section of the SRS portion of the document will be seciton 3.2. This section does a deeper dive into each feature and use case specification that makes up the application as a whole. To help reduce confusion on how this works we have provided below a template or example of what each feature and use case may look like. This template provides quick and easy bullet style details about each feature and use case that creates that particular feature.

Each feature will contain a feature name / title followed by a description of the feature. This will then be followed by a use case or user story which defines a key functional aspect of the specified feature. See below on how the table breaks apart the indivudal feature in the specified use case.


In the table below the definition is on the right of the words on the left.

Define the words on the left in more details.

### 3.2.x Feature Template Example

Full Feature Description. What the feature is. Who is going to use it. Why is this feature needed or wanted.

#### 3.2.x.y Use Case Name Example

| Data          | Description |

|Use Case Detail| The use case detail outlines the What, Who, Why of the use case. Example: As a User, I want to xxxxx because I am looking for an easier way to do my task.|
|XRef           | This is short for Cross Reference and links to different sections of the document. For example you may have a reference to a genearal diagram above in section 2.0. You should also have a reference to the validation section of the document that covers the verifiable portions of the use case functionality. Lastly, when the SDD portion of the document is created a link to that section will then be found here.|
|Trigger        | User, application, or external driven behavior events that happen based on automated or user input.|
|Precondition   | Represents the conditions, visually, data, logic, or other things that must exist prior to this feature or use case being able to be executed, used, or seen.|
|Basic Path     | This is the path on how the user gets to this feature or use case. How did I get here?|
|Alternate Path | There are often alternate ways to get to this feature or use case. "I used the help / search feature".|
|Post Condition | What happens when the user or process is triggered. What states exist afterward.|
|Exception Paths| In what cases are there exceptions to how or what something should or should not be doing. This is to be communicated as inclusive ideas.|
|Other          | This is for anything that was not covered in the previous table descriptions and in most cases will not contain details.|
